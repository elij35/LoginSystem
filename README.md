# Comp1004SocialMediaCoursework
My repository for **Comp1004 Computing Practice Coursework** about creating a social media website.

## Project vision

I will be responsible for creating a posting system that allows users to share their posts and see what their friends have posted.
The website should be intuitive and easily understandable so that users can quickly get acquainted to all aspects including:

- **Sharing stories and amongst friends**
This will involve being able to upload text in the form of 'posts' which is easily accessible to all in the users friends list.

- **Being able to see and react to friends posts**
Reacting includes the ability to like and comment on friendâ€™s posts and allowing the poster to see the likes and comments and reply back, creating a more social media website.

- **Deleting previous posts**
Being able to tidy up your online presence is only becoming more important so deleting posts the user no longer wants on the site will allow the user to be more comfortable with the website.

## How to use
The user should be able to go to the posts page on the website and see the posts of the users who are in their friends list as well as like or comment on their posts.

Now they could open a post creator which lets the user easily fill in a title and content of the post and press a button to finalize the post.

From here the user will be able to show only their own posts and either see and react to the comments and likes of their friends or delete the posts they no longer want on the website.
