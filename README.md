# COMP1004-Cluster-F
## Social media app
My repository for **Comp1004 Computing Practice Coursework** about creating a social media website.

I will be responsible for creating a login system for the application while my team (Cluster F) will work on other aspects. At completion together we should have a working social media website.

## Requirements
These are the functional requirements for the login system:
- As a user I would like to be able to log into my account from any location.
- As a user I would like to be able to log out of my account.
- As a user I would like my login to be secure and only accessible by myself.
- As a user I would like the website to remember I have logged in.

## Non-functional requirements
**Technical** : The application will run on a web-server and will be interfaced by the user using a web browser.

**Performance** : The application needs to run at a acceptable speed and be stable to use.

**Usability** : The interfaces must be accessable and easy to understand to new users.

**Security** : The login detail must be secure and unaccesable to public. Two factor authentication will be required to ensure account security.
