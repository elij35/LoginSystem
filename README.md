# Comp1004SocialMediaCoursework
My repository for **Comp1004 Computing Practice Coursework** about creating a social media website.

## Project vision

I will be responsible for creating a posting system that allows users to share their posts and see what their friends have posted.
The website should be intuitive and easily understandable so that users can quickly get acquainted to all aspects including:

- **Sharing stories and amongst friends**
This will involve being able to upload text in the form of 'posts' which is easily accessible to all in the users friends list.

- **Being able to see and react to friends posts**
Reacting includes the ability to like and comment on friend’s posts and allowing the poster to see the likes and comments and reply back, creating a more social media website.

- **Deleting previous posts**
Being able to tidy up your online presence is only becoming more important so deleting posts the user no longer wants on the site will allow the user to be more comfortable with the website.

The user should be able to go to the posts page on the website and see the posts of the users who are in their friends list as well as like or comment on their posts.

Now they could open a post creator which lets the user easily fill in a title and content of the post and press a button to finalize the post.

From here the user will be able to show only their own posts and either see and react to the comments and likes of their friends or delete the posts they no longer want on the website.


## How to use
From the homepage the start-up button can be clicked to add simulated accounts for the users and the user buttons can be used to simulate a user being logged in.
So that the posting can function the simulated accounts friends list and login is required. For this reason please ensure that both a current user has been chosen and the startup button have been clicked. If you have made changes e.g. liked, commented, deleated or created a post the reset button will reset the simulated accounts back to what they were.
The homepage also shows a diagram of the friends lists of all the simulated users.

Going to the sidebar you can click the post tab and see all the posts of your friends in order of newest to oldest.
The text box on the post will allow you to type a comment on the post which will be added when you press enter.
To like the post you can click the number of likes next to where the "like:" text is displayed. It will then turn green and add your like to the like counter. The alternative is also true as you can click again to unlike a post.

Looking at the sidebar again at the bottom a create post tab would have appeared. Click on the tab and you will be shown where you can input a title and content for a new post.

The other new tab on the sidebar is the ‘my post’ tab which when clicked will take you to a page containing only your own posts.
While looking at your own posts you can still comment like you would a friends post however you cannot like your own post.
Finally you can press the red 'Delete?' button which will prompt you whether you are sure you would like the delete the post. If you choose to delete the post it will be removed from storage and immediately taken off your my posts page.
